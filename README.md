# üå± Geochemical Nutrient Mapping of Agricultural Soils in Herrera, Panama Oeste

This repository contains the geochemical maps generated as part of the research project:  
**"Geochemical Nutrient Mapping of Agricultural Soils in Herrera (Panama Oeste) as a Tool for Farmers and the Sustainable Use of Natural Resources"**, published in the journal *Agriculture* ([DOI: 10.3390/agriculture15070702](https://doi.org/10.3390/agriculture15070702)).

## üìå Project Summary

This study aimed to geochemically characterize agricultural soils and irrigation waters in the Herrera township of Panama Oeste through the development of spatial nutrient distribution maps. By integrating physicochemical data from both soils and water samples with GIS techniques, we sought to provide actionable insights for improving agricultural productivity and sustainability.

## üéØ Objectives

- Characterize the physicochemical properties of agricultural soils in Herrera and georeference them.
- Characterize the physicochemical quality of surface and groundwater used for irrigation.
- Develop geochemical maps of macronutrients and other indicators to support sustainable land management practices.

## üß™ Methodology

- **Sampling**: 102 soil samples and 16 water samples (surface and groundwater) were collected across Herrera.
- **Soil analysis**: pH, electrical conductivity (EC), cationic exchange capacity (CEC), texture, organic matter, nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), aluminum (Al), cupper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), silicon (Si), and strontium (Sr).
- **Water analysis**: pH, EC, salinity, calcium (Ca), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), potassium (K), manganese (Mn), sodium (Na), nitrogen (N), nitrate (NO‚ÇÉ‚Åª), phosphate (PO‚ÇÑ¬≥‚Åª), bicarbonate (HCO‚ÇÉ‚Åª), and sulfate (SO‚ÇÑ¬≤‚Åª).
- **GIS mapping**: Spatial interpolation techniques [Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) and Kriging] were used to generate thematic nutrient maps.

## üåç Tools & Technologies

- ArcGIS for spatial analysis and map generation.
- Python for data processing and statistical analysis.

## üß≠ Study Area

The study area is located in the Herrera township, La Chorrera district, Panama Oeste province. The region features a tropical savanna climate and Tertiary volcanic geology (basalts and andesites), which significantly influence soil nutrient dynamics.

## üìä Key Results

- Nutrient availability showed significant spatial variability, especially for phosphorus and potassium.
- Some areas presented acidic soils with low nutrient retention, while others exhibited excesses due to fertilization.
- The maps allow identifying nutrient-deficient zones and guiding site-specific fertilization.

## üåø Impact

These geochemical nutrient maps are a valuable tool for precision agriculture, enabling more efficient use of fertilizers, improved crop planning, and sustainable land use practices.
